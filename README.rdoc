# This class provides a simple mechanism to find and cache a list 
# of files on your system (much like slocate). It is configured by thge 
# associated hungrynoodle.xml file - and expects only 2 parameters:
# * <dir>The directory to be searched/cached</dir>
# * <regex>The regular expression detailing the files to be cached</regex>   
# The class uses sqlite3 by default for storage of its information and logs
# debug information to hungrynoodle.txt
